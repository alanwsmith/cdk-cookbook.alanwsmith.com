    <p>
      This file is located at `/collector/index.html` in an S3 bucket. With the
      setup in this example, it is served for every url that starts with
      `/collector` regardless of the rest of the path.

    <p>
      This link changes with each page load or reqeust. The change is client
      side via javascript since the source always comes from the same origin
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <script>
        const arbitrary_link = `/collector/arbitrary-${new Date().getTime()}.html`
        document.write(`<a href="${arbitrary_link}">${arbitrary_link}</a>`)
