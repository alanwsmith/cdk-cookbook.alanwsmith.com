UPDATE the name to remove wildcard and
put in a better description. 

put in notes about how this is a simple
example. and regex would be useful
as well.

verify that urls are always starting from 
the `/` root in requests 

- point out that this is for an cloudfront
  edge function and not a lambda edge function

- make a lambda edge function example
